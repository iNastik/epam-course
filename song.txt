The world gets lonely
Find me something to believe in
Maybe I'm blind
The world's gone mad now
Find me something to believe in
Maybe I'm blind
See I've been waiting for so long
Waiting for so long
See I've been waiting for so long
Why does it always seem so wrong
Oh it seems so wrong
See I've been waiting for so long
